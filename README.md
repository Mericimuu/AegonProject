# AegonProject
Backend Side
I used javaspringboot and worked on spring tool suite as ide. 
Jpa and h2 dependencies were added to project in backend side. There are 2 services, 2 repos, 1 controller and 2 models through the project. 
H2 db is opened and tested with real values.

Frontend Side
Html and React js is used at the same page. Events were used in react and connected with database that datas come from backend side.
Best regards, Meri√ß.
